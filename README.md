Diabetes predictor using Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.                                                                                                          

The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.

In this project, several machine learning models were evaluated for their performance on the dataset. The models used include:

- Logistic Regression**
- Decision Tree**
- K-Nearest Neighbors**
- Support Vector Machine**
- Random Forest**
- Gradient Boosting**

Each model was assessed based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. 

The evaluation results indicate that Logistic Regression provides high accuracy and precision, while the Decision Tree and Gradient Boosting models are better at identifying positive cases.
